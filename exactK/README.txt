implement a calculation of an exact coverage factor for regression confidence bands, AR(1) noise model with normal eps distriburion

the analytical formula was proposed by G. Wimmer and V. Witkovsk√Ω, Institute of Measurement Science, Slovak Academy of Sciences, basing on:

Uusipaikka E., Exact Confidence Bands for Linear Regression Over Intervals, Journal of the American Statistical Association (1983) 87, 638-644
